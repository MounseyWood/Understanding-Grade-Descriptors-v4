- **Colour-Coded Bands**: Each grade has a distinctive visual identity to reinforce understanding
- **Improvement Guidelines**: Specific advice on how to move up to the next grade band
- **Complete Grading Matrix**: Comprehensive view of all grade bands and criteria in a single table

1. **Research and Analysis**: Critical examination of context and interpretation of sources
2. **Experimentation and Practice**: Testing of subject, thinking through making, technique, risk taking and problem solving
3. **Communication and Presentation**: Realisation of intentions and skill in appropriate media with awareness of audience needs
4. **Personal and Professional Development**: Planning, time-management, commitment & subject engagement
